                            <strong>Market economy</strong> is an economic system based on the principles of free enterprise, a variety of forms of ownership of the means of production, market pricing, contractual relations between economic entities, limited state intervention in the economic activities of entities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The market system is the markets of products and resources and the links operating between them, a mechanism that allows the prices prevailing in these markets to distribute rare economic resources, provide information about decisions made by consumers, firms and suppliers of resources, and coordinate these decisions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to a number of economists, the "market", by which it is commonly understood to be based on freedom of contract, pricing according to the law of supply and demand and counter-circulation of the money supply (that is, the commodity-money market system) is no more than one of the historically conditioned and historically incoming forms of commodity exchange and commodity distribution.

                            <strong>Planned economy</strong>, planned economy or command economy, command economy is an economic system in which material resources are in state or public ownership and distributed centrally, which obliges individuals and enterprises to act in accordance with a centralized economic plan. The system of centralized planning existed in the USSR and other countries that identified themselves as socialist. In the form of dirigisme, it was actively used during the Second World War and in the leading capitalist countries, for example, in Great Britain and France.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A planned economy can use centralized and decentralized planning or participatory forms of economic planning. A planned economy contrasts with an unplanned economy, especially a market economy, where autonomous firms operating in markets independently make decisions about production, distribution, pricing and investment. A market economy using indicative planning can also be called a planned market economy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With planned (command-administrative) management, state bodies almost completely plan the assortment and production volumes of all goods and services, regulate (by command methods) the prices of all products and the values of all wages. Investment decisions are also made centrally.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Such an economic system often denies private ownership of the means of production either completely or partially, and opposes itself to a market economy.

                            <strong>Traditional (patriarchal) economy</strong> is an economic system in which traditions and customs determine the practice of using limited resources. It is the most ancient. In a traditional economy, land and capital are in common ownership, and the main economic problems of society — what, how and for whom to produce - are solved mainly on the basis of traditional tribal or semi-feudal hierarchical relationships between people.

                            <strong>A mixed economy (hybrid economy)</strong> is an economic system that includes both private and corporate, as well as public or state ownership of the means of production. It allows private entrepreneurs and individuals to make independent financial decisions, but their autonomy is limited by the fact that the state or society has priority in these financial matters. Basically, the idea of a mixed economy adheres to the supporters of democratic socialism.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Within the framework of a mixed economy, both the state and private enterprises and corporations have the right to own or operate the means of production, freely move goods, carry out purchase and sale transactions, hire and fire employees, and in fact are equal market players.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The activity of the state is financed by taxes and excise taxes, but mainly by its own economic activity, which provides it with the necessary financial independence and has as its goal just the provision of its basic functions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A number of services vital to society and elements of the national infrastructure are financed or partially subsidized from the budget, or directly owned by the state: legal services, libraries, roads, schools, hospitals, law enforcement agencies, agriculture and related production of essential foodstuffs, the fuel and energy sector, housing and communal services, state monopolies, etc.
