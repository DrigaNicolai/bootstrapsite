                        <p>
                            The primary sector of the economy (in the three-sector model of the economy) unites industries related to the extraction of raw materials and its processing into semi-finished products. The primary sector includes agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting and extraction of fossil natural raw materials (coal, oil, metal ores, etc.).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The primary sector was the very first in the history of mankind, it began with the economic activity of primitive people (gathering and hunting). Until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the primary sector occupied the most important place in the world economy, and within the primary sector itself, agriculture was the most important industry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the primary sector of the economy, there is also a secondary sector (production of industrial products) and a tertiary sector (services).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The society existing in the conditions of the dominant primary sector of the economy is called pre-industrial, or agrarian.
                        </p>
                    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Secondary sector of the economy</h4> <a href="#top-menu">[up]</a>
                        <p>
                            The secondary sector of the economy is a sector in the three-sector model of the economy, which includes the manufacturing industry. It covers industries that produce ready-to-use products or participate in construction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This sector usually takes the products of the primary sector (i.e. raw materials) and creates finished products suitable for use by other enterprises, for export or for sale to domestic consumers (through distribution through the tertiary sector). Many of these industries consume large amounts of energy and require factories and equipment; depending on the number, they are often classified as light or heavy. They also produce waste and waste heat, which can cause environmental problems or cause pollution (see Negative externalities). Examples include textile manufacturing, automotive manufacturing, and handicrafts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The society existing in the conditions of the dominant secondary sector of the economy is called industrial.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the economy of Western Europe, the secondary sector has always dominated in the first half of the XIX century (Industrial Revolution) and until the beginning of the period after World War II. The reason for the transition from the primary sector economy to the secondary sector economy was the improvement of agricultural machinery and other extractive industries, which led to an increase in labor productivity. In this regard, surplus labor and resources were released, which went to the development of industry (you can use such a figurative example: if earlier a peasant could feed only himself and one or two people with his labor, then due to the increase in productivity he could feed a large group of people who, thus, were freed from the need to work in agriculture).
                        </p>
                    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Tertiary sector of the economy</h4> <a href="#top-menu">[up]</a>
                        <p>
                            The tertiary sector of the economy is the service sector (economic sector) of the state, which includes transport, communications, trade, tourism, healthcare and the like.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The transition to the dominant tertiary economy is associated with the "growth of labor productivity in industry" â€” and in real manifestation - with the displacement of people from the productive process, with their replacement with automated and robotic machines and production lines, in connection with which "resources are released" for the development of the service sector.
                        </p>
                    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Quaternary sector of the economy</h4> <a href="#top-menu">[up]</a>
                        <p>
                            The quaternary sector of the economy is the areas of the economy included in the concept of the knowledge economy. It includes scientific research and development necessary for the production of products from natural resources.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, a logging company may explore ways to use partially burned wood so that intact parts of the wood can be converted into wood pulp for paper production.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Information technology and the education sector (education economics) are also included in this sector.
                        </p>
