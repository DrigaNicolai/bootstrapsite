                <h2>Meaning</h2>
                <p>
                    Economics - the activity of society, as well as the totality of relations that develop in the system of production, distribution, exchange and consumption.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The economy has several forms and is divided into sectors. So it turns out to be a tricky science.

                <h2>Challenges of the modern economy</h2>
                <p>
                    The central theme of economics as a science is the contradiction between the infinity of people's needs and the limited resources for their satisfaction. Every economic system is faced with the need to make certain basic types of choices. Among them, the most important are the following: what goods should be produced, how they should be produced, who should do what work, and for whom the results of this work are intended. The need for each of these choices is dictated by resource constraints.

                                For simplicity, let's assume an economic system in which there are only two alternative goods, such as cars and education. For many students, life without a car is a sacrifice made to get an education. Similarly, in the economic system as a whole, there cannot be enough cars and education to satisfy everyone. It is necessary to choose - to make decisions in what quantities of which product to produce.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The inability to produce as many goods as people would like is a consequence of the scarcity of resources used to produce these goods. Even in order to produce the simplest products, we will have to combine a lot of resources. Natural resources are everything that can be used in production in a natural state, without processing, for example, fertile land, construction sites, wood, materials. So, to make a table, wood, nails, glue, a hammer, a saw, the work of a carpenter, a painter, and so on are required. For convenience, these resources are usually grouped as factors of production. Labor includes all the muscular and intellectual activity of people. Capital represents all productive resources that are created by people: tools, machines, infrastructure, as well as intangible assets (intellectual capital). All natural resources used in production (ore, air, water, etc.) are considered land.

                                There are several production methods for almost any product or service. Cars, for example, can be made in highly automated factories with a huge amount of capital equipment and a relatively small amount of labor, but they can also be made in small enterprises that use a large amount of labor and only some general-purpose machines. Ford cars are manufactured in the first way, and Lotus cars are manufactured in the second way. The same can be said about education. Economics can be taught in a small classroom, where one teacher at the blackboard works with twenty students, but the same subject can be studied using computer technologies of distance learning simultaneously for hundreds of students.

                                Efficiency is the main criterion when deciding how to produce. In everyday speech, the word efficiency means that production is carried out with minimal costs, efforts and losses. Economists use a more precise definition. The term economic efficiency refers to a state of affairs in which it is impossible to make any changes that more fully satisfy the desires of one person, without prejudice to the satisfaction of the desires of another person. Efficiency determined in this way is sometimes called Pareto efficiency, after the Italian economist Wilfredo Pareto. If there is a way to improve your situation without harming anyone, then it is pointless (inefficient) to pass by such an opportunity. If I have a fountain pen that I am not using at the moment, and you need this pen, then it would be a waste on your part to buy your own pen. It would be much more effective to lend you my pen; it improves your situation and does not worsen mine. When there is a way to improve the situation of both sides, it is wasteful not to take advantage of such an opportunity. You lend me a bike, and I'll lend you a volleyball. If I don't ride a bike very often, and you don't play volleyball very often, then it's not profitable for both of us to buy these things.
